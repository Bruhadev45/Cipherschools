Course Title: Full-Stack Web Development with MERN Stack

This Full-Stack Web Development course using the MERN Stack offers a comprehensive learning journey, covering both foundational and advanced topics. It begins with an introduction to full-stack development, providing an overview of the MERN stack and guiding students through setting up their development environment. The curriculum delves into MongoDB, where learners explore NoSQL databases, perform CRUD operations, and design schemas for data modeling. In the Express.js module, students are introduced to the framework, learn to build RESTful APIs, and handle middleware and routing.

The React.js section focuses on creating dynamic user interfaces, covering components, props, state, and the use of Redux for state management. Node.js is introduced next, with a focus on its ecosystem, asynchronous programming, and server management. Integration of the MERN stack is covered extensively, teaching students to connect React with Express, use Axios for HTTP requests, and implement authentication and authorization.

Advanced topics include deploying MERN applications, optimizing performance, and adhering to security best practices. The course emphasizes hands-on learning, culminating in a capstone project where students build a real-world application that integrates all the concepts they've learned. This structured approach ensures that learners are well-equipped to tackle real-world full-stack development challenges, making the MERN stack a powerful tool in their development toolkit.
